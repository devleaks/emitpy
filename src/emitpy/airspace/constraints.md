Types of constraints and handling


# Speed-based Constraints

## Minimum speed

?


## Maximum speed

### Below FL100

250kn



# Altitude-based Constraints


## Minimum altitude


## Maximum altitude


## MORA

At airspace level.



# Environmental Constraints


## Noise Abatment

Time dependant?

In general, can constraints be time-based? or dependent on other factor (time (time of day, day of week, seasonal), weather...)


## Toxic Gas Emission Reduction

(is it strictly equal to lower fuel consumption?)



# Computation for FMS/Flight plan


## Start

speed
vertical speed
alt

## Move

distance


## AC Capacity

accel/decel
vspeed min/max

## End - Goals

### Free

### Constrained

#### Speed


#### Altitude
