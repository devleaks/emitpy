Use STAR on arrival, SID on departure.
If no STAR: Go from last point to "approach" fix (straight line), from approach to final to (flare to ) touch down.
If no SID: Go from takeoff point to initial climb (straight line), turn torwards next fix and climb are reasonable rate.

If possible have a (timed) "mark" at each flight phase.

Two types of point: EMIT point where a position is emitted. MARK point where a new flight phase starts.
