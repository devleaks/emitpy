Flight path and Ground Support Vehicle path generator


Emitpy sofware aims at generate synthetic ADS-B messages as produced by both flying aircrafts or support vehicles
on the ground of the airport.

It is conceived as a box software, only accessible through a REST api, and producing ADS-B messages on a Redis queue.

This repository only contains code, it does not contain any data (which sometimes is private) which is necessary for it to run.

Document is added now. Be patient.

The generator software is written in Python.

The basic viwer software is written in JavaScript with node-red.

Emitpy sofware is a perpetual beta software.

Major releases are named after naval disasters.
