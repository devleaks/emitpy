# Aknowledgements

I thank the following software owners and programmers.

I used their tools and free software numerous time during the development of mine.

 1. X-Plane, for its open data, free data designer tool, and data documentation.
 2. Little Navmap, to the exceptional software to plan flights. I use it to visualize plan, procedures, transitions. I also visualize all my generated tracks on the moving map.
 3. LiveTraffic, to allow me to "inject" my generated tracks into X-Plane and get a "Digital Twin" vizualisation of them.
 4. XPPython3, to allow me to smoothly integrate my development to X-Plane
